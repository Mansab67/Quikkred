- Validation

## Security Architecture

### Zero-Trust Security Model
1. **Network Security**
   - VPC isolation
   - Private subnets
   - WAF protection
   - DDoS mitigation

2. **Application Security**
   - OWASP compliance
   - Input validation
   - SQL injection prevention
   - XSS protection

3. **Data Security**
   - AES-256 encryption at rest
   - TLS 1.3 in transit
   - Field-level encryption for PII
   - Key rotation

4. **Access Control**
   - RBAC implementation
   - MFA enforcement
   - API rate limiting
   - Audit logging
